# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive Python application built using **Pygame** to visualize various sorting algorithms such as **Bubble Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Heap Sort**. The purpose of this project is to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work by visualizing the process in real-time.

## Features

- Visualizes sorting algorithms in real-time
- Supports multiple algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- Allows the user to choose sorting order (Ascending/Descending)
- Interactive controls for easy experimentation
